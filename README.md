# Findit

this stupid simple app came when i was in process of developing a basic git like clone (will be made public soon) and i made a parser that parses the whole directory recursively and prints everything
and this was born from that with a few tweaks to the code it works well for now 

## How to use:

``` ./findit <PATH> <KEYWORD>  ```
Example:
``` ./findit . findit ```
