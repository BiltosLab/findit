# Findit

this stupid simple app came when i was in process of developing a basic git like clone (will be made public soon) and i made a parser that parses the whole directory recursively and prints everything
and this was born from that with a few tweaks to the code it works well for now 

## Usage:

``` ./findit <PATH> <KEYWORD>  ```

Example:
``` ./findit . findit ```

## Install:
``` sudo chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh```

### IM IN LOVE WITH C
